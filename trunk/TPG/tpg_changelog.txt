1. Renamed 'Declaration' to 'GlobalDecl'
2. Renamed 'InsideDeclaration' to 'LocalDecl'
3. Fixed bug that allows a code like this:
	int x[5](long y)
	{
		//code block here
	}
4. Added new terminal: VARIABLEPARAMS. This would allow a function code like this:
	int y(int a, char b, ...) //this means the function accepts an indefinite # of params (except for the first two which are required)
	{
		//code block here
	}
5. Modified 'Assignment' to allow a code like this:
	b = &a;
